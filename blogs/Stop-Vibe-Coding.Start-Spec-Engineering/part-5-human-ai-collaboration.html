            <blockquote>The AI writes the code. The human writes the architecture. Neither does it alone.</blockquote>
            <hr>
            <p>Every conversation about AI-assisted development arrives at the same question: <em>what happens to
                    software
                    engineers?</em></p>
            <p>Wrong question. The right question: <strong>in a world where AI can generate code from a design, what is
                    the most valuable thing a software engineer can do?</strong></p>
            <p>The answer is exactly what engineers were always supposed to be doing: making good architectural
                decisions.</p>

            <h2>The Role Shift</h2>
            <p>If a well-specified design generates production-quality implementation code, then the scarce resource is
                no longer code — it's <em>design</em>. That's not deskilling engineering. It's a
                <strong>promotion</strong> of
                the most valuable engineering work.</p>

            <h2>The Collaboration Lifecycle</h2>
            <pre><code>Product Team          Architect (Human)          AI Agent
─────────────         ──────────────────          ──────────────
Write User Stories →  Author/Review GASD     →  Generate Code
                      Make design decisions       Generate Tests
                      Resolve QUESTION blocks     Generate Docs
                      APPROVE the spec            Attach EVIDENCE
                                                  Open PR
                      Review Evidence         ←  Submit for merge
                      Merge or request changes</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Stage 2 — Architect Defines How</strong>: The architect authors the GASD spec. They are **the
                authority on every design decision**: authentication strategy, error handling, type contracts, and
                global invariants.</p>

            <p><strong>Stage 4 — Blocking Ambiguity Surfaces</strong>: When an agent hits a gap, it raises a
                <code>QUESTION</code> block instead of guessing. Human decides. Spec updated. Decision permanently
                recorded.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Stage 6 — Evidence Embedded</strong>: When the agent finishes, it attaches an
                <code>EVIDENCE</code>
                block with test coverage, passthrough rates, and validation dates directly into the spec.</p>

            <h2>GASD as Institutional Memory</h2>
            <p>One of the most corrosive problems: architectural decisions made by engineers who've left become
                invisible. GASD makes institutional memory explicit. Every decision is recorded, dated, attributed, and
                carries its <code>RATIONALE</code> in version control.</p>

            <h2>The Two Fears — Answered</h2>
            <p><strong>"Will GASD replace developers?"</strong> No. It replaces <em>routine implementation work</em>. It
                raises the value of trade-off analysis and architectural constraint-setting.</p>
            <p><strong>"Will juniors still learn?"</strong> Yes — arguably more. When decisions are explicit and
                reasoned in
                the spec, junior developers can read them, challenge them, and propose alternatives. That's how junior
                engineers become architects.</p>

            <h2>The New Measure of Senior Engineering</h2>
            <p>In a GASD-driven team, output is measured in quality of design decisions: how well did the spec eliminate
                ambiguity? How thoroughly do <code>DECISION</code> blocks capture trade-offs? How precisely do
                <code>TYPE</code> contracts prevent misuse?
            </p>

            <hr>
            <p><em>GASD turns one-time AI conversations into permanent architectural contracts. It makes senior
                    engineers
                    the design authorities they always should have been.</em></p>
