# Stop Vibe Coding. Start Spec Engineering

---

AI writes code fast. It also writes *different* code every time.

Same prompt. Different architecture. Different security decisions. No record of why.

Without discipline, AI velocity becomes a **debt accelerator** — AI amplifies whatever pipeline you already have.

The industry is responding. Amazon built **[Kiro](https://kiro.dev)** (spec-first agentic IDE). **[Tessl](https://tessl.io)** built a Spec Registry to stop agents hallucinating APIs. **The spec should be the source of truth. The code is the output.**

We spent a few weekends to build **GASD** — the General Agentic Software Design Language — a Design Bridge that locks in architectural decisions before a single line of code is generated.

No more silent guessing. No more drift. Every decision permanent, versioned, and traceable.

We've written a 6-part series on how this works in practice:

1️⃣ [Vibe Coding vs. Rigorous Engineering](part-1-vibe-coding-vs-rigorous-engineering.md)
2️⃣ [What is Spec-Driven Development](part-2-spec-driven-development.md) — and why AI makes it essential now
3️⃣ [GASD — A Design Language](part-3-gasd-design-language.md) for the Agentic Era
4️⃣ ⭐ [From User Story to Working Code](part-4-user-story-to-code-walkthrough.md) — full end-to-end walkthrough
5️⃣ [Human + AI](part-5-human-ai-collaboration.md) — The New Collaboration Model
6️⃣ [GASD 2.0](part-6-gasd-2-teaser.md) — The Multi-Agent Future
