            <blockquote>AI can write code faster than any human. So why do teams keep getting burned?</blockquote>

            <hr>

            <p>The productivity gains are real. AI coding tools genuinely accelerate output — boilerplate disappears,
                scaffolding takes minutes, not hours. We're not here to argue against that.</p>
            <p>We're here to talk about what comes after the demo.</p>

            <h2>"Plausible" ≠ "Correct"</h2>
            <p>AI coding tools are optimized for one thing: generating plausible code from a natural language
                description. Extraordinary capability. But "plausible" and "correct" are not the same thing — and "fast"
                and "consistent" are not synonyms.</p>
            <p>The enterprise software industry is beginning to discover this the hard way.</p>

            <h2>Vibe Coding vs. Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Vibe Coding</strong>: prompt the AI with a rough idea, accept whatever comes out, fix what
                breaks, ship it. For a weekend project? Delightful. For software that processes payroll, handles medical
                records, or manages financial transactions? A liability dressed as a productivity tool.</p>
            <p>The problem isn't speed. It's what gets silently decided at speed.</p>

            <h2>Agent Drift</h2>
            <p>Ask any LLM to build a user authentication service. Close the chat. Open a new session. Ask again.</p>
            <p>You get a different architecture.</p>
            <p>First response: JWT with Redis. Second: opaque tokens in Postgres. Both valid in isolation. Both
                reflecting completely different architectural decisions that cascade through your entire system.</p>
            <p>This is <strong>Agent Drift</strong> — the phenomenon where repeated generation from the same intent
                produces structurally divergent implementations. It's not a bug. It's the fundamental nature of
                probabilistic text generation. The model isn't trying to be consistent. It's generating a plausible next
                token.</p>
            <p>At scale, Agent Drift compounds. Different modules, different assumptions. Different error strategies.
                The codebase becomes a patchwork of micro-architectures — each sensible alone, incoherent together.</p>

            <h2>The Debt Accelerator</h2>
            <p>As the 2025 DORA report notes, AI acts as an <strong>amplifier</strong> — a mirror reflecting back the
                good, bad, and ugly of your entire pipeline. Speed was never the bottleneck. Design quality was.</p>
            <p>When a senior engineer writes code manually, every decision is deliberate. When an AI generates code,
                decisions are implicit — buried in statistical patterns from millions of repositories of varying
                quality. The faster you generate, the faster implicit-decision debt accumulates. You ship faster. You
                break faster. You refactor more.</p>
            <p>The velocity gain evaporates in maintenance.</p>

            <h2>No Single Source of Truth</h2>
            <p>This is the deeper problem the "AI makes you faster" narrative ignores:</p>
            <p><strong>In a vibe-coded workflow, there is no single source of truth for design decisions.</strong></p>
            <p>Why does the auth service use JWT and not opaque tokens? Check the chat history? The PR description? The
                comments — if any were generated? These are ephemeral, unsearchable, non-authoritative. The next
                developer (or agent) who touches that code has no reliable way to know what constraints the original
                decision was made under.</p>
            <p>AI makes this dramatically worse. The volume of implicit decisions explodes alongside the volume of
                generated code.</p>

            <h2>The Fix: Discipline Before Velocity</h2>
            <p>The teams succeeding at AI-assisted engineering at scale share one trait: they establish
                <strong>discipline</strong> before deploying <strong>velocity</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>They answer the architectural questions in writing before a prompt is written. They treat AI as a highly
                capable <em>implementer</em> — given a precise brief, it produces consistent, high-quality results.
                Given an ambiguous one, it produces inconsistent, surprising results. Just like any implementer.</p>
            <p><strong>Before you prompt an AI to write meaningful code, answer three questions in writing:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>What design decisions are locked?</strong> (auth strategy, error handling, transaction
                    model)</li>
                <li><strong>What types and constraints must hold?</strong> (validation rules, edge cases, invariants)
                </li>
                <li><strong>What is explicitly out of scope?</strong> (what the AI must not do, even if it seems
                    plausible)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Without answers in a stable, machine-readable form — you're vibe coding, and accumulating invisible debt
                with every generation.</p>
