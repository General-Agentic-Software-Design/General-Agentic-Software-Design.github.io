# Stop Vibe Coding. Start Spec Engineering

---

AI writes code fast, but it writes *different* code every time. Without discipline, AI velocity becomes a **debt accelerator** — amplifying whichever architectural drift or security gaps you already have.

The industry is responding. Amazon built **[Kiro](https://kiro.dev)** (spec-first agentic IDE). **[Tessl](https://tessl.io)** built a Spec Registry. The message is clear: **The spec is the source of truth. The code is only the output.**

We built **GASD** — the General Agentic Software Design Language — to act as a **Design Bridge** that locks in architectural decisions before a single line of code is generated. No more silent guessing. No more drift. Every decision is permanent, versioned, and traceable.

## Start Spec Engineering in 3 Steps

1. **Draft**: Convert User Stories or SRS into an initial GASD design.
2. **Review & Refine**: Human-in-the-loop review for architectural correctness and security.
3. **Generate**: Feed the locked-in GASD to an agent to produce consistent, production-ready code.
